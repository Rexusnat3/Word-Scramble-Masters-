Word Scramble Masters!
Word scramble Masters is a text based word scrambling game made in Python. 
It loads a dictionary of words from which it selects one at random, scrambles it,
and asks the player to guess the original word. If a player wants to they can get 
a hint which is the definition of the word. Scores are based on correct and incorrect 
guesses and the game will continue until the player decides to stop playing.
